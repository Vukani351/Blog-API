# Blog-API
This is my first node application that will have database hooked to it. I intend to have full CRUD  operations when I am done &amp; use it to provide data from the BLOG template we working on.

# Personal Notes: 

## mongoDB:
> Having issues when I am updating data so - [mongo put](https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/using-typescript-with-mongodb-tutorial#:~:text=ObjectId%20is%20a%20unique%20MongoDB,acts%20as%20the%20primary%20key.&text=Here%20we%20are%20adding%20properties,as%20part%20of%20the%20constructor.)

## Todo:

- [ ] Add erro middle were to handle error with data & status
- [ ] Add route for handling reset password. 1. add the email module, 2. send email & when user goes to that route with given token allow them to change the password.
- [ ] Restructure the code and attempt to do the functions using modules.
- [ ] Clean up the code by modulerizing things.
- [ ] Create error message & logging module with it's types.
- [ ] Create error, warning or message.
